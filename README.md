# Tech Blog
  ## Description
  An expiramental Tech Blog outline with a working Login/Logout function. Overall the server is quiet bare and has no styling besides the bootstrap nav, meaning it's still in development. You can create a User with 
a Username, Email, and Password then it'll take you to the Dashboard to create posts.
